    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class.\n",
    "# Direct access to some components of an object is restricted while controlled access is provided through methods. \n",
    "# Objects should be designed to hide the internal implementation details and expose only what is needed to interact with them from the outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers like private ('__') and protected ('_') to control the visibility of attributes \n",

    "# Abstraction, on the other hand, is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors. \n",

    "# an object does (methods) from how it achieves it (implementation details).\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, abstraction is often achieved through the use of abstract base classes (ABCs). ABCs define a common interface that subclasses \n",

    "\n",
    "# To sum up the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation emphasizes data hiding and controlled access to attributes and methods within a class. Basically, \n",
